# Claude Context & Reasoning Framework for Pulso-AI

## üß† REASONING FRAMEWORK - Always Follow This Process

### Step 1: UNDERSTAND THE REQUEST
Before responding, ask yourself:
1. **What type of request is this?**
   - [ ] Architecture/Design question
   - [ ] Implementation guidance  
   - [ ] Business logic clarification
   - [ ] Performance optimization
   - [ ] Client-specific configuration
   - [ ] Debugging/troubleshooting

2. **What's the user's context level?**
   - [ ] Technical lead (needs architecture reasoning)
   - [ ] Developer (needs implementation details)
   - [ ] Stakeholder (needs business impact)
   - [ ] New contributor (needs onboarding)

3. **What phase are we in?**
   - [ ] Phase 0: Foundation (focus on structure, documentation)
   - [ ] Phase 1: MVP Core (focus on Movistar working)
   - [ ] Phase 2: Multi-client (focus on scalability)
   - [ ] Later phases (focus on advanced features)

### Step 2: APPLY PROJECT PRINCIPLES
Always filter decisions through these principles:
1. **Client Isolation First**: Any suggestion that could cause data leakage = automatic rejection
2. **Performance Aware**: Consider ETL and query performance implications
3. **Configuration Over Code**: Prefer YAML/JSON config over hardcoded logic
4. **MVP Mindset**: Simplest solution that delivers business value
5. **Multi-tenant Native**: Design choices must work for 50+ clients

### Step 3: STRUCTURE RESPONSE
1. **Lead with Business Impact**: Why does this matter?
2. **Provide Technical Reasoning**: Step-by-step logic
3. **Show Concrete Examples**: Use Movistar/Claro/Tigo scenarios
4. **Include Implementation Path**: Next actionable steps
5. **Highlight Risks/Considerations**: What could go wrong?

### Step 4: VALIDATE DECISION
Before finalizing response, check:
- [ ] Does this align with hexagonal architecture?
- [ ] Is this scalable to 50+ clients?
- [ ] Will this perform with 100K+ records?
- [ ] Can this be configured without code changes?
- [ ] Does this maintain security isolation?

## üéØ PROJECT CONTEXT & ORIGIN

### The Real Problem
This project was born from a real conversation with a developer facing a critical business challenge:

**Original Issue**: Client has multiple telecom companies (Movistar Peru, Claro Colombia, Tigo Guatemala) needing dashboards for debt collection/cobranza analytics. Each client requires:
- 2-3 months of custom development per client
- Different data sources (BigQuery, PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- Different field names but similar business logic
- Cross-client data isolation (CRITICAL - regulatory requirement)
- Dashboard customization without code changes

**Business Impact**: 
- Current approach: 9-13 weeks per client
- Target: 4-6 hours per client (98% time reduction)
- Revenue multiplier: Can serve 50x more clients with same team

### Technical Context
User's team is **Python-focused** and specifically requested:
- **Polars over pandas** for ETL performance (10-30x faster)
- **Hexagonal Architecture** for clean separation
- **GraphQL over REST** for complex dashboard queries with cross-filtering
- **Multi-tenant by design** with complete client isolation
- **Configuration over code** for new client onboarding

## ü§î DECISION TREES - Use These for Common Scenarios

### When User Asks About Architecture:
```
Is this about data flow?
‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Explain: Extract (adapters) ‚Üí Transform (Polars) ‚Üí Load (datamart) ‚Üí Serve (GraphQL)
‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Is this about client isolation?
    ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Explain: Template + isolated instances + API gateway routing
    ‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Is this about performance? ‚Üí Explain: Polars + caching + async patterns
```

### When User Asks About Implementation:
```
What layer is this?
‚îú‚îÄ Domain ‚Üí Pure Python, no dependencies, business logic only
‚îú‚îÄ Application ‚Üí Use cases, orchestrate domain + repositories
‚îú‚îÄ Infrastructure ‚Üí Adapters (BigQuery, PostgreSQL), external concerns
‚îî‚îÄ API ‚Üí GraphQL resolvers, authentication, routing
```

### When User Asks About New Client Setup:
```
What's different about this client?
‚îú‚îÄ Data source ‚Üí Create new adapter, same interface
‚îú‚îÄ Field names ‚Üí Update configuration YAML only
‚îú‚îÄ Business rules ‚Üí Extend homologation rules
‚îî‚îÄ UI customization ‚Üí Configure dashboard templates
```

## üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS & REASONING

### Why Hexagonal Architecture?
**REASONING CHAIN:**
1. **Problem**: Multiple clients with different data sources
2. **Need**: Swap data adapters without changing business logic
3. **Solution**: Ports & Adapters pattern
4. **Benefit**: Domain pure, easy testing, client isolation

### Why Polars over Pandas?
**REASONING CHAIN:**
1. **Problem**: ETL performance with 100K+ records per client
2. **Constraint**: Need 10-30x performance improvement
3. **Solution**: Polars (Rust-based, Arrow-native)
4. **Evidence**: Benchmarks show 10-30x speedup for typical operations

### Why GraphQL over REST?
**REASONING CHAIN:**
1. **Problem**: Complex dashboard queries with cross-filtering
2. **Need**: Dynamic schema per client + exact data fetching
3. **REST Issues**: Multiple requests, over-fetching, rigid schema
4. **GraphQL Benefits**: Single request, exact data, dynamic schema generation

### Multi-Tenant Strategy: Template + Isolated Instances
**REASONING CHAIN:**
1. **Evaluated**: Single app multi-tenant (rejected: security risk)
2. **Evaluated**: Fork per client (rejected: maintenance nightmare)
3. **Chosen**: Template + isolated deployments
4. **Benefits**: Complete isolation + shared business logic + easy maintenance

## üìä REAL-WORLD DATA EXAMPLES

### Movistar Peru Configuration
```yaml
# Real field mappings from conversation
dimensions:
  ejecutivo: {source_field: "ejecutivo", type: "categorical"}
  servicio: {source_field: "linea_servicio", valid_values: ["MOVIL", "FIJA"]}
  cartera: {source_field: "tipo_cartera", valid_values: ["Gesti√≥n Temprana", "Altas Nuevas"]}

metrics:
  pdps_por_hora: {formula: "pdp_count / horas_trabajadas"}
  tasa_contactabilidad: {formula: "(contactos / total_gestiones) * 100"}

data_source:
  type: "bigquery"
  project: "mibot-222814"
  dataset: "BI_USA"
  table: "dash_P3fV4dWNeMkN5RJMhV8e_vw_operativo"
```

### Cross-Filtering Business Logic
Real example from conversation: When user filters by "Ejecutivo" ‚Üí automatically suggest relevant values for "Cartera" and "Servicio" based on actual data relationships.

### Homologation Challenge
Different clients use different terminology:
- Movistar: "ejecutivo" ‚Üí Claro: "agente" ‚Üí Tigo: "asesor"
- Same business concept, different field names and values
- Need automatic mapping with confidence scoring
